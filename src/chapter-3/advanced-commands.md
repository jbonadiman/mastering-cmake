# Advanced Commands
There are a few commands that can be very useful, but are not typically used in writing CMakeLists files. This section will discuss a few of these commands and when they are useful.

First, consider the [`add_dependencies`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_dependencies.html#command:add_dependencies) command which creates a dependency between two targets. CMake automatically creates dependencies between targets when it can determine them. For example, CMake will automatically create a dependency for an executable target that depends on a library target. The [`add_dependencies`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_dependencies.html#command:add_dependencies) command is typically used to specify inter-target dependencies between targets where at least one of the targets is a custom target (see [Add Custom Command](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/book/mastering-cmake/chapter/Custom%20Commands.html#add-custom-command) section).

The [`include_regular_expression`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/include_regular_expression.html#command:include_regular_expression) command also relates to dependencies. This command controls the regular expression that is used for tracing source code dependencies. By default, CMake will trace all the dependencies for a source file including system files such as stdio.h. If you specify a regular expression with the [`include_regular_expression`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/include_regular_expression.html#command:include_regular_expression) command, that regular expression will be used to limit which include files are processed. For example; if your software projectâ€™s include files all started with the prefix foo (e.g. `fooMain.c` `fooStruct.h`, etc.), you could specify a regular expression of `^foo.*$` to limit the dependency checking to just the files of your project.
