# Flow Control
The CMake language provides three flow control constructs to help organize your CMakeLists files and keep them maintainable.

- Conditional statements (e.g. [`if`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/if.html#command:if))
- Looping constructs (e.g. [`foreach`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/foreach.html#command:foreach) and [`while`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/while.html#command:while))
- Procedure definitions (e.g. [`macro`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/macro.html#command:macro) and [`function`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/function.html#command:function))
