# Basic Commands
As we saw earlier, the [`set`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/set.html#command:set) and [`unset`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/unset.html#command:unset) commands explicitly set or unset variables. The [`string`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/string.html#command:string), [`list`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/list.html#command:list), and [`separate_arguments`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/separate_arguments.html#command:separate_arguments) commands offer basic manipulation of strings and lists.

The [`add_executable`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_executable.html#command:add_executable) and [`add_library`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_library.html#command:add_library) commands are the main commands for defining the executables and libraries to build, and which source files comprise them. For Visual Studio projects, the source files will show up in the IDE as usual, but any header files the project uses will not be. To have the header files show up, simply add them to the list of source files for the executable or library; this can be done for all generators. Any generators that do not use the header files directly (such as Makefile based generators) will simply ignore them.
