# Regular Expressions
A few CMake commands, such as [`if`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/if.html#command:if) and [`string`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/string.html#command:string), make use of regular expressions or can take a regular expression as an argument. In its simplest form, a regular expression is a sequence of characters used to search for exact character matches. However, many times the exact sequence to be found is unknown, or only a match at the beginning or end of a string is desired. Since there are several different conventions for specifying regular expressions, CMakeâ€™s standard is described in the [`string`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/string.html#command:string) command documentation. The description is based on the open source regular expression class from Texas Instruments, which is used by CMake for parsing regular expressions.
