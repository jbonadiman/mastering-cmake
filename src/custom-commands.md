# Custom Commands
Frequently the build process for a software project goes beyond simply compiling libraries and executables. In many cases, additional tasks may be required during or after the build process. Common examples include: compiling documentation using a documentation package; generating source files by running another executable; generating files using tools for which CMake doesnâ€™t have rules (such as lex and yacc); moving the resulting executables; post processing the executable, etc. CMake supports these additional tasks using the [`add_custom_command`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_command.html#command:add_custom_command) and [`add_custom_target`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_target.html#command:add_custom_target) commands. This chapter will describe how to use custom commands and targets to perform complex tasks that CMake does not inherently support.

## Portable Custom Commands
Before going into detail on how to use custom commands, we will discuss how to deal with some of their portability issues. Custom commands typically involve running programs with files as inputs or outputs. Even a simple command, such as copying a file, can be tricky to do in a cross-platform way. For example, copying a file on UNIX is done with the `cp` command, while on Windows it is done with the `copy` command. To make matters worse, frequently the names of files will change on different platforms. Executables on Windows end with .exe, while on UNIX they do not. Even between UNIX implementations there are differences, such as which extensions are used for shared libraries; .so, .sl, .dylib, etc.

CMake provides three main tools for handling these differences. The first is the `-E` option (short for execute) to [`cmake`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#manual:cmake(1)). When the [`cmake`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#manual:cmake(1)) executable is passed the `-E` option, it acts as a general purpose, cross-platform utility command. The arguments following the `-E` option indicate what [`cmake`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#manual:cmake(1)) should do. These options provide a platform-independent way to perform a few common tasks including copy or remove files, compare and conditionally copy, time, create symlinks and others.
The [`cmake`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#manual:cmake(1)) executable can be referenced by using the [`CMAKE_COMMAND`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_COMMAND.html#variable:CMAKE_COMMAND) variable in your CMakeLists files, as later examples will show.

Of course, CMake doesn't limit you to using `cmake -E` in all your custom commands. You can use any command that you like, though it's important to consider portability issues when doing it. A common practice is to use [`find_program`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_program.html#command:find_program) to find an executable (Perl, for example), and then use that executable in your custom commands.

The second tool that CMake provides to address portability issues is a number of variables describing the characteristics of the platform. The [`cmake-variables(7)`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-variables.7.html#manual:cmake-variables(7)) manual lists many variables that are useful for custom commands that need to reference files with platform-dependent names.  These include [`CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX.html#variable:CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX),
[`CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX.html#variable:CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX), etc. which describe file naming conventions.

Finally, CMake supports [`generator expressions`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html#manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)) in custom commands. These are expressions that use the special syntax `$<...>`
and are not evaluated while processing CMake input files, but are instead delayed until generation of the final build system.  Therefore, the values substituted for them know all the details of their evaluation context, including the current build configuration and all build properties associated with a target.

## Add Custom Command
Now we will consider the signature for [`add_custom_command`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_command.html#command:add_custom_command). In Makefile terminology, [`add_custom_command`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_command.html#command:add_custom_command) adds a rule to a Makefile. For those more familiar with Visual Studio, it adds a custom build step to a file. [`add_custom_command`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_command.html#command:add_custom_command) has two main signatures: one for adding a custom command to a target and one for adding a custom command to build a file.

The target is the name of a CMake target (executable, library, or custom) to which you want to add the custom command. There is a choice of when the custom command should be executed. You can specify as many commands as you want for a custom command. They will be executed in the order specified.

Now let us consider a simple custom command for copying an executable once it has been built.
```cmake
# first define the executable target as usual
add_executable(Foo bar.c)

# then add the custom command to copy it
add_custom_command(
  TARGET Foo
  POST_BUILD
  COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND}
  ARGS -E copy $<TARGET_FILE:Foo> /testing_department/files
  )
```

The first command in this example is the standard command for creating an executable from a list of source files. In this case, an executable named `Foo` is created from the source file `bar.c`. Next is the [`add_custom_command`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_command.html#command:add_custom_command) invocation. Here the target is simply `Foo` and we are adding a post build command. The command to execute is [`cmake`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#manual:cmake(1)) which has its full path specified in the [`CMAKE_COMMAND`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_COMMAND.html#variable:CMAKE_COMMAND) variable. Its arguments are `-E copy` and the source and destination locations. In this case, it will copy the `Foo` executable from where it was built into the `/testing_department/files` directory. Note that the `TARGET` parameter accepts a CMake target (`Foo` in this example), but arguments specified to the `COMMAND` parameter normally require full paths. In this case, we pass to `cmake -E copy`, the full path to the executable referenced via the `$<TARGET_FILE:...>` generator expression.

## Generate a File

The second use for [`add_custom_command`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_command.html#command:add_custom_command) is to add a rule for how to build an output file. Here the rule provided will replace any current rules for building that file. Keep in mind that [`add_custom_command`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_command.html#command:add_custom_command) output must be consumed by a target in the same scope. As discussed later, the [`add_custom_target`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_target.html#command:add_custom_target) command can be used for this.

### Using an Executable to Build a Source File
Sometimes a software project builds an executable that is then used for generating source files, which are used to build other executables or libraries. This may sound like an odd case, but it occurs quite frequently. One example is the build process for the TIFF library, which creates an executable that is then run to generate a source file that has system specific information in it. This file is then used as a source file in building the main TIFF library. Another example is the Visualization Toolkit (VTK), which builds an executable called `vtkWrapTcl` that wraps C++ classes into Tcl. The executable is built and then used to create more source files for the build process.
```cmake
###################################################
# Test using a compiled program to create a file
####################################################

# add the executable that will create the file
# build creator executable from creator.cxx
add_executable(creator creator.cxx)

# add the custom command to produce created.c
add_custom_command(
  OUTPUT ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/created.c
  DEPENDS creator
  COMMAND creator ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/created.c
  )

# add an executable that uses created.c
add_executable(Foo ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/created.c)
```

The first part of this example produces the `creator` executable from the source file `creator.cxx`. The custom command then sets up a rule for producing the source file `created.c` by running the executable `creator`. The custom command depends on the `creator` target and writes its result into the output tree ([`PROJECT_BINARY_DIR`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/PROJECT_BINARY_DIR.html#variable:PROJECT_BINARY_DIR)). Finally, an executable target called `Foo` is added, which is built using the `created.c` source file. CMake will create all the required rules in the Makefile (or Visual Studio workspace) so that when you build the project, the `creator` executable will be built, and run to create `created.c`, which will then be used to build the `Foo` executable.

## Adding a Custom Target
In the discussion so far, CMake targets have generally referred to executables and libraries. CMake supports a more general notion of targets, called custom targets, which can be used whenever you want the notion of a target but without the end product being a library or an executable. Examples of custom targets include targets to build documentation, run tests, or update web pages. To add a custom target, use the [`add_custom_target`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_target.html#command:add_custom_target) command.

The name specified will be the name given to the target. You can use that name to specifically build that target with Makefiles (make name) or Visual Studio (right-click on the target and then select Build). If the optional `ALL` argument is specified, this target will be included in the `ALL_BUILD` target and will automatically be built whenever the Makefile or Project is built. The command and arguments are optional; if specified, they will be added to the target as a post-build command. For custom targets that will only execute a command this is all you will need. More complex custom targets may depend on other files, in these cases the `DEPENDS` arguments are used to list which files this target depends on. We will consider examples of both cases. First, let us look at a custom target that has no dependencies:
```cmake
add_custom_target(FooJAR ALL
  ${JAR} -cvf "\"${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/Foo.jar\""
              "\"${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/Java\""
  )
```

With the above definition, whenever the `FooJAR` target is built, it will run Javaâ€™s Archiver (jar) to create the `Foo.jar` file from java classes in the `${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/Java` directory. In essence, this type of custom target allows the developer to tie a command to a target so that it can be conveniently invoked during the build process. Now let us consider a more complex example that roughly models the generation of PDF files from LaTeX. In this case, the custom target depends on other generated files (mainly the end product .pdf files)
```cmake
# Add the rule to build the .dvi file from the .tex
# file. This relies on LATEX being set correctly
#
add_custom_command(
  OUTPUT  ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/doc1.dvi
  DEPENDS ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/doc1.tex
  COMMAND ${LATEX} ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/doc1.tex
  )

# Add the rule to produce the .pdf file from the .dvi
# file. This relies on DVIPDF being set correctly
#
add_custom_command(
  OUTPUT  ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/doc1.pdf
  DEPENDS ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/doc1.dvi
  COMMAND ${DVIPDF} ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/doc1.dvi
  )

# finally add the custom target that when invoked
# will cause the generation of the pdf file
#
add_custom_target(TDocument ALL
  DEPENDS ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/doc1.pdf
  )
```

This example makes use of both [`add_custom_command`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_command.html#command:add_custom_command) and [`add_custom_target`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_target.html#command:add_custom_target). The two [`add_custom_command`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_command.html#command:add_custom_command) invocations are used to specify the rules for producing a .pdf file from a .tex file. In this case, there are two steps and two custom commands. First a .dvi file is produced from the .tex file by running LaTeX, then the .dvi file is processed to produce the desired .pdf file. Finally, a custom target is added called TDocument. Its command simply echoes out what it is doing, while the real work is done by the two custom commands. The `DEPENDS` argument sets up a dependency between the custom target and the custom commands. When TDocument is built, it will first look to see if all of its dependencies are built. If any are not built, it will invoke the appropriate custom commands to build them. This example can be shortened by combining the two custom commands into one custom command, as shown in the following example:
```cmake
# Add the rule to build the .pdf file from the .tex
# file. This relies on LATEX and DVIPDF being set correctly
#
add_custom_command(
  OUTPUT  ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/doc1.pdf
  DEPENDS ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/doc1.tex
  COMMAND ${LATEX}  ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/doc1.tex
  COMMAND ${DVIPDF} ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/doc1.dvi
  )

# finally add the custom target that when invoked
# will cause the generation of the pdf file

add_custom_target(TDocument ALL
  DEPENDS ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/doc1.pdf
  )
```

Now consider a case where the documentation consists of multiple files. The above example can be modified to handle many files by using a list of inputs and a [`foreach`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/foreach.html#command:foreach) loop. For example
```cmake
# set the list of documents to process
set(DOCS doc1 doc2 doc3)

# add the custom commands for each document
foreach(DOC ${DOCS})
  add_custom_command(
    OUTPUT  ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/${DOC}.pdf
    DEPENDS ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/${DOC}.tex
    COMMAND ${LATEX} ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/${DOC}.tex
    COMMAND ${DVIPDF} ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/${DOC}.dvi
    )

  # build a list of all the results
  list(APPEND DOC_RESULTS ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/${DOC}.pdf)
endforeach()

# finally add the custom target that when invoked
# will cause the generation of the pdf file
add_custom_target(TDocument ALL
  DEPENDS ${DOC_RESULTS}
  )
```

In this example, building the custom target `TDocument` will cause all of the specified .pdf files to be generated. Adding a new document to the list is simply a matter of adding its filename to the `DOCS` variable at the top of the example.

## Specifying Dependencies and Outputs
When using custom commands and custom targets you will often be specifying dependencies. When you specify a dependency or the output of a custom command, you should always specify the full path. For example, if the command produces `foo.h` in the binary tree then its output should be something like `${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/foo.h`. CMake will try to determine the correct path for the file if it is not specified; complex projects frequently end up using files in both the source and build trees, this can eventually lead to errors if the full paths are not specified.

When specifying a target as a dependency, you can leave off the full path and executable extension, referencing it simply by its name. Consider the specification of the generator target as an [`add_custom_command`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_command.html#command:add_custom_command) dependency in the example earlier in this chapter. CMake recognizes `creator` as matching an existing target and properly handles the dependencies.

## When There Isnâ€™t One Rule For One Output
There are a couple of unusual cases that can arise when using custom commands that warrant further explanation. The first is a case where one command (or executable) can create multiple outputs, and the second is when multiple commands can be used to create a single output.

### A Single Command Producing Multiple Outputs
In CMake, a custom command can produce multiple outputs simply by listing multiple outputs after the `OUTPUT` keyword. CMake will create the correct rules for your build system so that no matter which output is required for a target, the right rules will be run. If the executable happens to produce a few outputs but the build process is only using one of them, then you can simply ignore the other outputs when creating your custom command. Say that the executable produces a source file that is used in the build process, and also an execution log that is not used. The custom command should specify the source file as the output and ignore the fact that a log file is also generated.

Another case of having one command with multiple outputs is when the command is the same but the arguments to it change. This is effectively the same as having a different command, and each case should have its own custom command. An example of this was the documentation example, where a custom command was added for each .tex file. The command is the same but the arguments passed to it change each time.

### Having One Output That Can Be Generated By Different Commands
In rare cases, you may find that you have more than one command that you can use to generate an output. Most build systems, such as make and Visual Studio, do not support this and likewise CMake does not. There are two common approaches that can be used to resolve this. If you truly have two different commands that produce the same output and no other significant outputs, then you can simply pick one of them and create a custom command for it.

In more complex cases there are multiple commands with multiple outputs; for example:
```cmake
Command1 produces foo.h and bar.h
Command2 produces widget.h and bar.h
```

There are a few approaches that can be used in this case. You might consider combining both commands and all three outputs into a single custom command, so that whenever one output is required, all three are built at the same time. You could also create three custom commands, one for each unique output. The custom command for `foo.h` would invoke Command1, while the one for `widget.h` would invoke Command2. When specifying the custom command for `bar.h`, you could choose either Command1 or Command2.
