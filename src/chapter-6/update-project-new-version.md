# Updating a Project For a New Version of CMake
When a CMake release introduces new policies, it may generate warnings for some existing projects. These warnings indicate that changes to a project may be necessary for dealing with the new policies. While old releases of a project can continue to build with the warnings, the project development tree should be updated to take the new policies into account. There are two approaches to updating a tree: one-shot and incremental. The question of which one is easier depends on the size of the project and which new policies produce warnings.
