# Introduction

This book describes how to use the CMake family of tools, including CTest, CPack and CDash, to develop, build, test, and package software for distribution. Starting with the basics of how to install and run the command-line and GUI tools, Mastering CMake covers how to write CMake code as well as how to convert existing projects to CMake. Finally, a series of guides, including the CMake tutorial, provide hands-on examples.
