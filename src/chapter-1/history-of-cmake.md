# The History of CMake
Since 1999, CMake has been under active development and has matured to the point where it is a proven solution for a wide range of build issues. CMake development began as part of the [Insight Toolkit (ITK)](http://www.itk.org/), funded by the U.S. National Library of Medicine. ITK is a large software project that works on many platforms and can interact with many other software packages. To support this, a powerful, yet easy-to-use build tool was required. Having worked with build systems for large projects in the past, the developers designed CMake to address these needs. Since then CMake has continuously grown in popularity, with many projects and developers adopting it for its ease-of-use and flexibility. The most telling example of this is the successful adoption of CMake as the build system of the [K Desktop Environment (KDE)](https://kde.org/), arguably the largest open-source software project in existence.

CMake also includes software testing support in the form of CTest. Part of the process of testing software involves building the software, possibly installing it, and determining what parts of the software are appropriate for the current system. This makes CTest a logical extension of CMake as it already has most of this information. In a similar vein, CMake contains CPack, which is designed to support cross-platform distribution of software. It provides a cross-platform approach to creating native installations for your software, making use of existing popular packages such as WiX, RPM, Cygwin, and PackageMaker.

CMake continues to track and support popular build tools as they become available. CMake has quickly provided support for new versions of Microsofts’s Visual Studio and Apple’s Xcode IDE. In addition, support for the new build tool Ninja from Google has been added to CMake. With CMake, once you write your input files you get support for new compilers and build systems for free because the support for them is built into new releases of CMake and not tied to your software distribution. CMake also has ongoing support for cross-compiling to other operating systems or embedded devices. Most commands in CMake properly handle the differences between the host system and the target platform when cross-compiling.
