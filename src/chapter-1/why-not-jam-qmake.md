# Why Not Use JAM, qmake, SCons, or ANT?
Other tools such as ANT, qmake, SCons, and JAM have taken different approaches to solving these problems and they have helped us to shape CMake. Of the four, qmake is the most similar to CMake, although it lacks much of the system interrogation that CMake provides. Qmake’s input format is more closely related to a traditional Makefile. ANT, JAM, and SCons are also cross-platform although they do not support generating native project files. They do break away from the traditional Makefile-oriented input with ANT using XML; JAM using its own language; and SCons using Python. A number of these tools run the compiler directly, as opposed to letting the system’s build process perform that task. Many of these tools require other tools such as Python or Java to be installed before they will work.
