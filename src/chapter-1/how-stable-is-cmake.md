# How Stable is CMake?
Before adopting any new technology or tool for a project, a developer will want to know how well supported and popular the tool is. Since the initial CMake implementation , CMake has grown in popularity as a build tool. Both the developer and user communities continue to grow. CMake has continued to develop support for new build technologies and tools as they become available. The CMake development team has a strong commitment to backwards compatibility. If CMake can build your project once, it should always be able to build your project. Also, since CMake is an open-source project, the source code is always available for a project to edit and patch as needed.
