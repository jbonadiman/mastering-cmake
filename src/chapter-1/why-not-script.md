# Why Not Script It Yourself?
Some projects use existing scripting languages such as Perl or Python to configure build processes. Although similar functionality can be achieved with systems like this, over-use of these tools can make the build process more of an Easter egg hunt than a simple-to-use build system. When building your software package, users are forced to find and install version 4.3.2 of this and 3.2.4 of that before they can even start the build process. To avoid that problem, it was decided that CMake would require no more tools than the software it was being used to build would require. At a minimum, using CMake requires a C compiler, that compilerâ€™s native build tools, and a CMake executable. CMake was written in C++, requires only a C++ compiler to build, and precompiled binaries are available for most systems. Scripting it yourself also typically means you will not be generating native Xcode or Visual Studio workspaces, making Mac and Windows builds limited.
