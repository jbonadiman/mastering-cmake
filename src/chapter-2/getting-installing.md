# Getting and Installing CMake on Your Computer
Before using CMake, you will need to install or build the CMake binaries on your system. On many systems, you may find that CMake is already installed or is available for installation with the standard package manager tool for the system. Cygwin, Debian, FreeBSD, OS X MacPorts, Mac OS X Fink, and many others all have CMake distributions.

If your system does not have a CMake package, you can find CMake precompiled for many common architectures on the CMake [Download](https://cmake.org/download) page. Select the desired release and follow the download instructions. CMake may be installed to any directory, so root privileges are not required for installation.

If you do not find precompiled binaries for your system, then you can build CMake from source. To build CMake, you will need a modern C++ compiler and the source distribution from the [CMake Download](https://cmake.org/download) page or [Kitwareâ€™s GitLab instance](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake). To build CMake, follow the instructions in `README.rst` at the top of the source tree.
