# Directory Structure
There are two main directories CMake uses when building a project: the source directory and the binary directory. The source directory is where the source code for the project is located. This is also where the CMakeLists files will be found. The binary directory is sometimes referred to as the build directory and is where CMake will put the resulting object files, libraries, and executables. CMake will not write any files to the source directory, only to the binary directory.

Out-of-source builds, where the source and binary directories are different, are strongly encouraged. In-source builds where the source and binary directories are the same are supported but should be avoided if possible. Out-of-source builds make it very easy to maintain a clean source tree and allow quick removal of all of the files generated by a build. Having the build tree differ from the source tree also makes it easy to support having multiple builds of a single source tree. This is useful when you want to have multiple builds with different options but just one copy of the source code.
