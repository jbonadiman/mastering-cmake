# Specifying the Compiler to CMake
On some systems, you may have more than one compiler to choose from or your compiler may be in a non-standard place. In these cases, you will need to specify to CMake where your desired compiler is located. There are three ways to specify this: the generator can specify the compiler; an environment variable can be set; or a cache entry can be set. Some generators are tied to a specific compiler; for example, the Visual Studio 19 generator always uses the Microsoft Visual Studio 19 compiler. For Makefile-based generators, CMake will try a list of usual compilers until it finds a working one.

The lists can be preempted with environment variables that can be set before CMake is run. The `CC` environment variable specifies the C compiler, while `CXX` specifies the C++ compiler. You can specify the compilers directly on the command line by using `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=cl` for example. Once [`cmake`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#manual:cmake(1)) has been run and picked a compiler, if you wish to change the compiler, start over with an empty binary directory.

The flags for the compiler and the linker can also be changed by setting environment variables. Setting `LDFLAGS` will initialize the cache values for link flags, while `CXXFLAGS` and `CFLAGS` will initialize `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` and `CMAKE_C_FLAGS` respectively.
