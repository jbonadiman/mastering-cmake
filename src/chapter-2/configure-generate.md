# Configure and Generate
After a CMakeLists file has been created, CMake processes the text file and creates entries in a cache file. Users may edit the CMakeLists file or specify cache values with the CMake gui or ccmake and re-configure. Next, CMake uses the cache entries to generate a project in the userâ€™s desired build system (e.g. Makefile or Visual Studio solution).
