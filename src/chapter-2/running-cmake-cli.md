# Running CMake from the Command Line
From the command line, the [`cmake`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#manual:cmake(1)) executable can be used to generate a project buildsystem. This is best suited for projects with few or no options. For larger projects like VTK, using [`ccmake`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ccmake.1.html#manual:ccmake(1)), or the [`cmake-gui`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-gui.1.html#manual:cmake-gui(1)) is recommended. To build a project with [`cmake`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#manual:cmake(1)), first create and change directory to where you want the binaries to be placed. Run [`cmake`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#manual:cmake(1)) specifying the path to the source tree and pass in any options using the -D flag. Unlike [`ccmake`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/ccmake.1.html#manual:ccmake(1)), or the [`cmake-gui`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-gui.1.html#manual:cmake-gui(1)), the configure and generate steps are combined into one when using the [`cmake`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#manual:cmake(1)) executable.
