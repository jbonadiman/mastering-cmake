# CMakeLists Files
The CMakeLists files (actually `CMakeLists.txt` but it is common to leave off the extension) are plain text files that contain the project description in CMakeâ€™s Language. The [`cmake-language`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-language.7.html#manual:cmake-language(7)) is expressed as a series of comments, commands and variables. You might wonder why CMake decided to have its own language instead of using an existing one such as Python, Java, or Tcl. The main reason is that CMake developers did not want to make CMake require an additional tool to run. By requiring one of these other languages, all users of CMake would be required to have that language installed, and potentially a specific version of that language. This is on top of the language extensions that would be required to do some of the CMake work, for both performance and capability reasons.
