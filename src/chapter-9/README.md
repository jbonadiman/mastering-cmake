# System Inspection
This chapter will describe how to use CMake to inspect the environment of the system where the software is being built. This is a critical factor in creating cross-platform applications or libraries. It covers how to find and use system and user installed header files and libraries. It also covers some of the more advanced features of CMake, including the [`try_compile`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/try_compile.html#command:try_compile) and [`try_run`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/try_run.html#command:try_run) commands. These commands are extremely powerful tools for determining the capabilities of the system and compiler that is hosting your software.
