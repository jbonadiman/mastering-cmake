# Key Concepts
This chapter provides an introduction to CMakeâ€™s key concepts. As you start working with CMake, you will run into a variety of concepts such as targets, generators, and commands. Understanding these concepts will provide you with the working knowledge you need to create effective CMakeLists files. Many CMake objects such as targets, directories and source files have properties associated with them. A property is a key-value pair attached to a specific object. The most generic way to access properties is through the [`set_property`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/set_property.html#command:set_property) and [`get_property`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/get_property.html#command:get_property) commands. These commands allow you to set or get a property from any object in CMake that has properties. See the [`cmake-properties`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-properties.7.html#manual:cmake-properties(7)) manual for a list of supported properties. From the command line a full list of properties supported in CMake can be obtained by running [`cmake`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#manual:cmake(1)) with the `--help-property-list` option.
