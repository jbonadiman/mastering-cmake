# Targets
Probably the most important item is targets. Targets represent executables, libraries, and utilities built by CMake. Every [`add_library`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_library.html#command:add_library), [`add_executable`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_executable.html#command:add_executable), and [`add_custom_target`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_target.html#command:add_custom_target) command creates a target. For example, the following command will create a target named “foo” that is a static library, with `foo1.c` and `foo2.c` as source files.
```cmake
add_library(foo STATIC foo1.c foo2.c)
```

The name “foo” is now available for use as a library name everywhere else in the project, and CMake will know how to expand the name into the library when needed. Libraries can be declared as a particular type such as `STATIC`, `SHARED`, `MODULE`, or left undeclared. `STATIC` indicates that the library must be built as a static library. Likewise, `SHARED` indicates it must be built as a shared library. `MODULE` indicates that the library must be created so that it can be dynamically-loaded into an executable. Module libraries are implemented as shared libraries on many platforms, but not all. Therefore, CMake does not allow other targets to link to modules. If none of these options are specified, it indicates that the library could be built as either shared or static. In that case, CMake uses the setting of the variable [`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.html#variable:BUILD_SHARED_LIBS) to determine if the library should be `SHARED` or `STATIC`. If it is not set, then CMake defaults to building static libraries.

Likewise, executables have some options. By default, an executable will be a traditional console application that has a main entry point. One may specify a `WIN32` option to request a WinMain entry point on Windows systems, while retaining main on non-Windows systems.

In addition to storing their type, targets also keep track of general properties. These properties can be set and retrieved using the [`set_target_properties`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/set_target_properties.html#command:set_target_properties) and [`get_target_property`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/get_target_property.html#command:get_target_property) commands, or the more general [`set_property`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/set_property.html#command:set_property) and [`get_property`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/get_property.html#command:get_property) commands. One useful property is [`LINK_FLAGS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/prop_tgt/LINK_FLAGS.html#prop_tgt:LINK_FLAGS), which is used to specify additional link flags for a specific target. Targets store a list of libraries that they link against, which are set using the [`target_link_libraries`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_link_libraries.html#command:target_link_libraries) command. Names passed into this command can be libraries, full paths to libraries, or the name of a library from an [`add_library`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_library.html#command:add_library) command. Targets also store the link directories to use when linking, and custom commands to execute after building.
